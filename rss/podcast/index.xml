<h2 id="the-hazard-podcast-america's-biggest-crime-scene" tabindex="-1">The Hazard Podcast - America’s Biggest Crime Scene</h2>
<p>The chemical company Diamond Alkali, one of the nation’s main producers of Agent Orange, spent years dumping chemical waste into the Passaic River and polluting Newark’s Ironbound neighborhood. Dioxin, a dangerous byproduct of the company’s work, was found in high levels in the neighborhood in the early ’80s, spurring emergency government action and leaving residents concerned about the safety of their homes and front yards.</p>
<p>State and federal authorities pledged to clean the mess up but today, nearly 40 years later, toxic mud still lies beneath the water — a 17-mile-long stretch of river that U.S. Sen. Cory Booker has called “America’s biggest crime scene.” Now the cleanup is facing a $1.8 billion price tag, an uncertain timeline, and the growing threat that intense storms fueled by climate change could stir the pollution up out of the river and back into the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Support for Hazard NJ is provided by Peril and Promise, a public media reporting initiative covering the human stories of climate change and its solutions, with major funding provided by Dr. P. Roy Vagelos and Diana T. Vagelos. You can learn more at <a href="https://pbs.org/perilandpromise" target="_blank">pbs.org/perilandpromise</a></p>

<p>TORRENTIAL RAINS.</p>
<p>HOWLING WINDS.</p>
<p>WIDESPREAD FLOODING.</p>
<p>IN 2012... HURRICANE SANDY WAS ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE STORMS TO MENACE THE EAST COAST IN DECADES.</p>
<p>THE STORM SLAMMED INTO THE NEW JERSEY COASTLINE... CREATING A TIDAL SURGE THAT FORCED THE PASSAIC RIVER AND NEWARK BAY OVER THEIR BANKS AND INTO NEWARK'S IRONBOUND NEIGHBORHOOD.</p>
<p>THIS SMALL GRID OF STREETS IS SURROUNDED BY TOXIC SITES: FACTORIES... A POWER PLANT... WAREHOUSES... CHEMICAL REFINERIES... NEW JERSEY'S LARGEST TRASH INCINERATOR... AND THE DIAMOND ALKALI SUPERFUND SITE.</p>
<p>THAT LAND, WHICH ONCE HELD AN AGENT ORANGE FACTORY, IS JUST ONE PART OF THE TOXIC SITE. THE REST IS A GOOEY MIXTURE OF MUD... SAND... AND CHEMICALS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PASSAIC RIVER.</p>
<p>TERRIFIED RESIDENTS WERE FORCED TO FLEE AFTER SANDY FILLED THEIR HOMES WITH POLLUTED WATER.</p>
<p>CLIMATE CHANGE HAS SET THE STAGE FOR MORE SANDY-SIZE MEGA-STORMS IN YEARS TO COME... AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE PASSAIC RIVER WILL FLOOD AGAIN.</p>
<p>WHEN IT DOES... THERE'S A RISK OF THESE CHEMICALS BEING STIRRED UP.</p>
<p>IF THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE IS NOT CLEANED UP SOON... THIS TOXIC NIGHTMARE WILL CONTINUE.</p>
<p>THIS IS HAZARD... A LIMITED SERIES ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SUPERFUND SITES HERE IN NEW JERSEY.</p>
<p>I'M JORDAN GASS-POORE'... AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST FROM TEXAS.</p>
<p>I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A HURRICANE... BUT WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD THERE WAS A MASSIVE FLOOD IN MY HOMETOWN OF SEGUIN TEXAS.</p>
<p>I REMEMBER WATCHING REFRIGERATORS FLOAT DOWN THE RIVER AND WONDERING WHAT KINDS OF CHEMICALS COULD BE LEACHING INTO THE WATER AND INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES.</p>
<p>AFTER THE FLOOD... NO ONE REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF DRINKING OR SWIMMING IN FREON-CONTAMINATED WATER. THERE WERE RUMORS THOUGH OF THREE-EYED FISH.</p>
<p>THE IRONBOUND ... WITH ABOUT FIFTY-THOUSAND RESIDENTS... HAS MORE PEOPLE THAN SEGUIN.</p>
<p>WHEN I VISITED THE NEIGHBORHOOD... I DIDN'T HEAR ANY STORIES OF THREE-EYED FISH... BUT I WAS TOLD NOT TO EAT ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THE PASSAIC RIVER.</p>
<p>THERE ARE SIGNS ALL AROUND RIVERFRONT PARK WARNING GUESTS NOT TO CATCH AND EAT CRAB AND FISH FROM THE RIVER.</p>
<p>THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE AREA'S INDUSTRIAL LEGACY... AND SERVES AS A STARK REMINDER THAT THE IRONBOUND IS STILL EXTREMELY POLLUTED.</p>
<p>NEARLY A DECADE AFTER SANDY... RESIDENTS OF THE IRONBOUND ARE STILL AFRAID OF THE LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF THE TOXINS THAT SPILLED INTO THEIR HOMES.</p>
<p>AND THEY HAVE A GOOD REASON TO BE.</p>
<p>JUST A FEW FEET AWAY IS A SUPERFUND SITE. AND NOT JUST ANY SUPERFUND SITE... ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE ON THE LIST.</p>
<p>THE DIAMOND ALKALI SUPERFUND SITE SITS AT THE HEART OF THE IRONBOUND.</p>
<p>IT WAS A FORMER FACTORY WHERE THE DEADLY HERBICIDE AGENT ORANGE WAS MANUFACTURED THROUGHOUT THE VIETNAM WAR.</p>
<p><strong>Maria Lopez-Nuñez -- Deputy Director of Organizing and Advocacy, Ironbound Community Corporation</strong></p>
<p>So, the Diamond Alkali site, it was the largest producer of Agent Orange in the world, and everyone talks about this one thing: a white powder that, like, covered the whole factory, you know, like, everything was covered in this white dust, and it was, like, a sticky dust. So, if you walked in, you would get it all over your shoes and that dust was dioxin. And so, it was being carried all over the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>MARIA LOPEZ-NUNEZ IS LEADING THE FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AS AN ORGANIZER WITH THE IRONBOUND COMMUNITY CORPORATION... OR ICC.</p>
<p>THE ICC WAS STARTED 52 YEARS AGO WHEN RESIDENTS CREATED A DAYCARE CENTER.</p>
<p>THEY LATER FOUGHT AGAINST THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GARBAGE INCINERATOR FROM COMING INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.</p>
<p>AND IT'S BEEN A WILD RIDE EVER SINCE.</p>
<p>AGENT ORANGE... NAMED FOR THE ORANGE IDENTIFICATION STRIPES PAINTED ON ITS BARRELS... CONTAINED DIOXIN. THAT'S A HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL THAT HAS NO COLOR OR ODOR.</p>
<p>DIOXIN WAS AMONG THE TOXIC CHEMICALS FOUND IN 1978 AT ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS SUPERFUND SITES... LOVE CANAL.</p>
<p>IN 1983... 14 YEARS AFTER DIAMOND ALKALI CLOSED... DIOXIN WAS FOUND IN THE IRONBOUND.</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Zak -- Ironbound resident and activist</strong></p>
<p>In the swimming pool there was dioxin discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THAT'S NANCY ZAK.</p>
<p>SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE HAYS PARK SWIMMING POOL. DIOXIN WAS FOUND AROUND A DRAIN THERE WHEN OFFICIALS WERE TESTING THE AREA FOR THE CHEMICAL.</p>
<p><strong>Larry Stuelpnagel -- New Jersey Nightly News, 1983</strong></p>
<p>The dioxin was discovered as technicians looked for the possible spread of contamination from the former Diamond Alkali plant one-half mile away.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>BEFORE THE DISCOVERY... THERE WERE REPORTS THAT SOME OF THE CHILDREN WHO SWAM THERE DEVELOPED SKIN RASHES.</p>
<p>NANCY AND HER HUSBAND... ARNOLD COHEN... HAVE BEEN ACTIVISTS IN THE IRONBOUND FOR DECADES.</p>
<p>ARNOLD SAYS THE DISCOVERY OF DIOXIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD DIDN'T COME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE.</p>
<p><strong>Arnold Cohen -- Ironbound resident and activist</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, you knew there's a lot of toxic industries along the river, but yet the extent of it was unbelievable that, you know, you're talking about, could talk about the largest concentrations of dioxin found anywhere in soil blocks away from where we lived was completely shocking.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THE IRONBOUND IS A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY THAT'S ALREADY FACED A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS.</p>
<p>IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES LIVING NEXT TO THESE HAZARDOUS SITES THAT NO ONE WANTS IN THEIR BACKYARD.</p>
<p>ADVOCATES CALL THIS ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM.</p>
<p>WITHIN THE TANGLE OF ROADS... RAILWAYS... AND HIGHWAYS... THERE ARE PEOPLE... JUST TRYING TO LIVE THEIR LIVES.</p>
<p>RESIDENTS OF THE IRONBOUND ARE PREDOMINANTLY HISPANIC... AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS LONG BEEN AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY.</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY... THIS ISN'T SURPRISING. MOST OF NEW JERSEY'S SUPERFUND SITES ARE IN THE BACKYARDS OF LOW-INCOME... OR MINORITY COMMUNITIES WHO ALREADY FACE A GREATER RISK OF HEALTH PROBLEMS.</p>
<p>AND NOW... CLIMATE CHANGE THREATENS TO DAMAGE SUPERFUND SITES LIKE DIAMOND ALKALI... AND SPREAD POLLUTION EVEN FURTHER.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Cory Booker -- D, New Jersey</strong></p>
<p>I'm one of the, I would imagine, few senators that lives in a city that has the number of Superfund sites this one has and surprise, surprise, I'm a senator, I think the only senator who lives in a low-income black and brown community.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THE INEQUITIES ARE FRUSTRATING FOR MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE TO CLEANUP DIAMOND ALKALI.</p>
<p>NANCY AND ARNOLD ORGANIZED DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE 1980S.</p>
<p>THEY BROUGHT THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER TO PROTEST AGAINST THE STATE'S HANDLING OF THE DIOXIN CONTAMINATION... AND TO STOP FUTURE POLLUTION.</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Zak -- Ironbound resident and activist</strong></p>
<p>It's always important; how many people you have involved and how many are calling up their councilman and stuff like that. So, we would have big demonstrations where people could come out. And that gave us, you know, just having those numbers is very important when you're dealing with any politicians of any kind.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>AS A CHILD... DOCTOR ANA BAPTISTA AND HER FAMILY PARTICIPATED IN SOME OF THESE EVENTS.</p>
<p><strong>Ana Baptista -- Co-Chair, Passaic River Superfund Community Advisory Group</strong></p>
<p>My parents bought a house down on the industrial end of town and my neighbor down the street, June, like, was knocking on all the neighbor's doors; she saw that we had moved in. And my parents, you know, don't speak English. So, she's, like, &quot;We're fighting the incinerator, so tell your parents to come to this meeting at the Rec Center.&quot; And they had like a little flyer in Portuguese and Spanish and English. And I told my parents about it. And I would go with them to these meetings to translate. And I was like, maybe 10, 9, 10 years old. I'm sure I did a terrible job translating. But there I was.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>ANA SAYS HER PARENT MOVED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM PORTUGAL IN THE 1980S. THEY GOT INVOLVED WITH THE ICC EARLY ON AND AS ANA GREW OLDER... SHE JOINED IN THE FIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>Ana Baptista -- Co-Chair, Passaic River Superfund Community Advisory Group</strong></p>
<p>It was a very intergenerational fight. You know, the timeline also feels, like, impossibly long. But, like most things, you just have to keep showing up for them to come to life.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>GROWING UP... ANA SAYS SHE STAYED AWAY FROM THE PASSAIC RIVER.</p>
<p><strong>Ana Baptista -- Co-Chair, Passaic River Superfund Community Advisory Group</strong></p>
<p>The little you knew about the river was don't get near it. Don't go in it. Definitely don't touch it, like, everybody knew, like, it was a dirty river, very polluted.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>SHE SHOWED ME AROUND RIVERFRONT PARK... ONE OF THE FEW GREENSPACES IN THE AREA.</p>
<p>THE PARK OPENED IN 2013 AND EXPANDED A FEW YEARS LATER.</p>
<p>RIVERFRONT PARK SHOULDN'T BE HERE. THAT IS... IF ESSEX COUNTY AND THE CITY OF NEWARK HAD THEIR WAY IN THE '90S.</p>
<p>THE PARK WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL STADIUM. BUT THE IRONBOUND COMMUNITY CORPORATION DID WHAT THE ORGANIZATION HAS ALWAYS DONE BEST... FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL ON BEHALF OF RESIDENTS.</p>
<p><strong>Ana Baptista -- Co-Chair, Passaic River Superfund Community Advisory Group</strong></p>
<p>So, that just shows you that back then there was not much of a premium or value put to parks, especially on a waterfront that was really contaminated. They just didn't see the value of it. But residents, you know, kept it alive.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>ANA AND OTHER LONG-TIME RESIDENTS OF THE IRONBOUND REMEMBER PLAYING IN AND AROUND THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE AS CHILDREN.</p>
<p>THEY ATE FOOD GROWN IN SOIL THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TAINTED WITH DIOXIN.</p>
<p>TRUCKS COMING IN-AND-OUT OF THE FACTORY TRACKED DIOXIN THROUGHOUT NEWARK.</p>
<p>COULD THESE EXPERIENCES BE THE CAUSE OF BIRTH DEFECTS AND CANCER?</p>
<p>MAYBE. THERE AREN'T MANY STUDIES LOOKING AT THE LONG-TERM HEALTH EFFECTS OF DIOXIN.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Miles -- Executive Director, New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance</strong></p>
<p>It wasn't until my own family was impacted by the sort of things that we know happen, you know, when you live in a neighborhood with pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>MELISSA MILES IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE NEW JERSEY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Miles -- Executive Director, New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance</strong></p>
<p>When you're pregnant and you live too close to roadways that have diesel pollution, when you have children in a community that has an issue with lead in the water, like, these things started to manifest in my own family and that's when it really became more of a mission for me to make sure that other parents in this community, you know, knew what was happening and that they had a voice and that they could stand up and fight for their community that they lived in.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE PASSAGE OF THE STATE'S LANDMARK ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL IN 2020.</p>
<p>THE BILL REQUIRES COMPANIES TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BEFORE BUILDING... EXPANDING... OR RENEWING PERMITS IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.</p>
<p>COMPANIES ALSO HAVE TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS AND PROVIDE A STATEMENT ON HOW THE PROJECT'S GOING TO IMPACT RESIDENTS BEFORE THEY GET APPROVED.</p>
<p>THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD NOW... BUT THINGS LIKE IMPACT STATEMENTS AND APPROVAL FROM THE DEP JUST WEREN'T TOP OF MIND WHEN THE DIAMOND ALKALI PLANT CLOSED IN 1969.</p>
<p>IT WAS THE MORNING OF JUNE 3... THEN-GOVERNOR TOM KEAN DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY.</p>
<p><strong>Gov. Tom Kean -- R, Governor of New Jersey 1982-1990. Speaking in 1983.</strong></p>
<p>We've asked the EPA to immediately begin cleaning the street in question. The dirt may be contaminated with dioxin. We expect that cleanup, which will consist of large-scale vacuuming with special equipment, will begin today, and all the homes so far sampled in the entire area have come back showing now dioxin contamination. It appears the contaminated dirt is not finding its way into residences</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THE ORDER STOPPED TRAIN TRAFFIC... EXPANDED AN EXISTING BAN AGAINST EATING CRAB AND FISH FROM THE PASSAIC... AND SHUT DOWN THE NEWARK FARMERS' MARKET... WHERE MANY RESIDENTS BOUGHT THEIR FOOD.</p>
<p>GOVERNOR KEAN OFFERED TEMPORARY HOUSING AT THE NEWARK YMCA FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED WITHIN 300 YARDS OF THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE.</p>
<p>FOR EVERYONE IN THE CITY... HE ADVISED THEM TO STAY INDOORS DURING THE CLEANUP.</p>
<p>THE NEXT DAY... RESIDENTS SAW PEOPLE IN &quot;MOON SUITS&quot; WITH HEADGEAR AND RESPIRATORS DIGGING AROUND THEIR FRONT YARDS.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Schapiro -- New Jersey Nightly News, 1983</strong></p>
<p>Federal environmental officials went door-to-door in Newark's Ironbound neighborhood today. They wanted the contents of people's vacuum cleaner bags. To find out if traces of deadly dioxin may have drifted a block or two from the original site at 80 Lister Avenue.</p>
<p>PHOTOS FROM THE TIME SHOW EPA WORKERS VACUUMING UP DIRT TO TEST IT FOR DIOXIN.</p>
<p>MARIA LOPEZ NUNEZ WITH THE ICC REMEMBERS HEARING THESE STORIES FROM RESIDENTS WHO LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE TIME OF THE &quot;INVASION.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Maria Lopez-Nuñez -- Deputy Director of Organizing and Advocacy, Ironbound Community Corporation</strong></p>
<p>You hear, especially from folks that have lived here their whole lives, that they were sitting there in their T-shirts because this was happening in the summer there in tank tops and shorts sitting on the porch being like, &quot;Why do you need a Hazmat suit?&quot; You know, like that contrast of the government workers looking like they were on the moon, but they were just in the Ironbound.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>DIOXIN HAD MOVED FROM THE DIAMOND ALKALI PLANT AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD... MUCH FURTHER THAN WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ORIGINALLY TOLD THEM.</p>
<p>RESIDENTS FELT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. SO... THEY FORMED THE IRONBOUND HEALTH ADVISORY COMMISSION.</p>
<p>THE ORGANIZATION DEMANDED HEALTH CHECKS FOR RESIDENTS... MORE TESTING FOR DIOXIN AND OTHER TOXIC CHEMICALS... AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN DECISION MAKING.</p>
<p>THERE WERE GOOD REASONS FOR RESIDENTS TO NOT TRUST THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>OFFICIALS WITH THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY HAD RECEIVED A FEDERAL REPORT THAT THERE WAS LIKELY DIOXIN AT THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE... THREE YEARS BEFORE ANY TESTS WERE CONDUCTED.</p>
<p>SOME HOMEOWNERS THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST A RUSE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE AWAY THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO MAKE WAY FOR NEW BUSINESS.</p>
<p>TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE... FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS... DIAMOND ALKALI DUMPED AN ESTIMATED 700,000 GALLONS OF DIOXIN INTO THE PASSAIC RIVER.</p>
<p>THE TRICKY THING ABOUT DIOXIN IS THAT IT CAN ATTACH ITSELF TO PARTICLES... LIKE DUST... AND SPREAD EASILY. IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO DISSOLVE IN WATER.</p>
<p>AT THE TIME... THE EPA CLAIMED THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW DANGEROUS DIOXIN REALLY WAS.</p>
<p>RITA M. LAVELLE... FORMER HEAD OF THE SUPERFUND PROGRAM... TOLD REPORTERS IN 1983</p>
<p>&quot;IT GETS ME THAT SOME SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING DIOXIN IS THE MOST DEADLY CHEMICAL KNOWN TO MAN. THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT DEPENDS ON THE CONCENTRATION. IN THE RIGHT CONCENTRATION, TABLE SALT IS JUST AS DEADLY.&quot;</p>
<p>LAVELLE WAS LATER FOUND TO HAVE MISUSED SUPERFUND DOLLARS DURING HER TIME WITH THE EPA.</p>
<p>SCIENTISTS KNEW THE CHEMICAL WAS AN INDUSTRIAL BY-PRODUCT. BUT THE ONLY EVIDENCE THEY HAD OF DIOXIN'S HARMFUL EFFECTS WAS CAUSING THE SKIN CONDITION CHLORACNE... WHICH RESEMBLES SEVERE ACNE.</p>
<p>LATER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A RARE FORM OF CANCER CALLED SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMAS IS LINKED TO DIOXIN EXPOSURE.</p>
<p>SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMAS ARE AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF CANCER THAT DEVELOPS IN THE BODY'S CONNECTIVE TISSUES.</p>
<p>EIGHT CASES OF CANCER WERE REPORTED BY DIAMOND ALKALI WORKERS. NONE WERE IDENTIFIED AS SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMAS.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gordon -- Environmental Lawyer</strong></p>
<p>They had literally every conceivable environmental threat going on in the Ironbound community at the time. And lo and behold, the next thing that happened was the discovery of the highest levels of dioxin ever found anywhere in the world in the Ironbound on the plant site. So, there was literally pandemonium.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THAT'S ATTORNEY MICHAEL GORDON. HE SPENT MUCH OF THE 1980S TRYING TO FIND PROOF THAT DIAMOND ALKALI KNEW DIOXIN WAS A PROBLEM AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.</p>
<p>IT WASN'T EASY. BUT ONE DAY IN 1986 GORDON FOUND INTERNAL MEMOS BETWEEN A DIAMOND ALKALI EMPLOYEE AND OFFICIALS AT A CHEMICAL COMPANY IN GERMANY.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gordon -- Environmental Lawyer</strong></p>
<p>They sent around their experience to all of the manufacturers of Agent Orange in America at the time, which was Diamond Alkali, Dow, Monsanto, a number of, Hercules, and they described what they had to do from an outbreak of illness amongst their workers to prevent the formation of dioxin which greatly reduced the threat of illness to the workers. And they described controlling the temperature and the pressure when you made this product.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THE DOCUMENTS PROVED THAT DIAMOND ALKALI KNEW FOR YEARS THAT DIOXIN POSED A HEALTH RISK TO ITS WORKERS... BUT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Gordon -- Environmental Layer</strong></p>
<p>And they did not convert to that process, because they had a small, older plant. And the government was literally buying everything they could produce for a period of time for use in Vietnam. And they did not want to delay production, shut down, reconfigure or rebuild the plant. So, they chose not to incorporate those measures. And that's why they produced some of the highest levels of dioxin found in the Agent Orange product.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>GORDON FINALLY HAD A CASE AGAINST THE COMPANY.</p>
<p>IN 1986... FORMER WORKERS SUED THE COMPANY FOR DAMAGES. THEY ALSO SUED THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE HOPE THAT THEY'D BE FORCED TO CLEAN UP THE SITE.</p>
<p>AFTER THE SEVENTH WEEK OF THE TRIAL... DIAMOND ALKALI AGREED TO A $1 MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT.</p>
<p>ABOUT A YEAR AFTER DIOXIN WAS DISCOVERED IN THE IRONBOUND... THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE WAS ADDED TO THE SUPERFUND LIST IN 1984.</p>
<p>OVER THE YEARS... THE BUILDINGS ON THE PROPERTY WERE DEMOLISHED... AND SOME OF THE TOXIC WASTE WAS BURIED THERE UNDERGROUND.</p>
<p>THE PROPERTY ITSELF WAS CAPPED WITH CONCRETE AND GRAVEL.</p>
<p>BUT... A 17-MILE STRETCH OF THE PASSAIC RIVER REMAINS SO POLLUTED THAT EVEN TRYING TO CLEAN IT UP MAY PROVE TO BE DISASTROUS.</p>
<p>A THICK LAYER OF DIOXIN FROM THE FACTORY IS BURIED TWELVE FEET IN THE RIVER. LOCALS CALL THIS STICKY SLUDGE &quot;BLACK MAYONNAISE.&quot;</p>
<p>TRYING TO GET DOWN TO THIS LAYER OF DIOXIN COULD CAUSE THE CHEMICAL TO SPREAD UP AND DOWN THE RIVER.</p>
<p>THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS SEDIMENT SHOULD BE REMOVED... AND IF IT IS REMOVED... IF IT CAN BE DONE SAFELY.</p>
<p>RIGHT NOW... CLEANUP PLANS CALL FOR DREDGING SOME OF THE CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS FROM THE RIVER. THAT MUCK WOULD THEN BE TREATED AT A FACILITY THAT HASN'T BEEN BUILT YET IN THE IRONBOUND.</p>
<p>THE REMAINING SEDIMENT WOULD BE CAPPED WITH A THICK LAYER OF SAND. CAPPING IS A COMMON WAY OF CLEANING UP SUPERFUND SITES. THE IDEA IS TO PREVENT ANOTHER STORM FROM KICKING UP THE CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT.</p>
<p>THIS PLAN HAS MIXED REVIEWS.</p>
<p>WHILE THE EPA SAYS THE CAP'S DESIGN TAKES CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS INTO ACCOUNT... OTHERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE MODELS USED ARE OUTDATED.</p>
<p>THERE'S ALSO THE WORRY THAT ONCE CLEANUP BEGINS... THE CONSTRUCTION COULD CAUSE DIOXIN-LACED DUST TO SPREAD FURTHER.</p>
<p>MARIA LOPEZ-NUNEZ WORRIES ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE IRONBOUND IF THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE IS IMPACTED BY RISING SEA LEVELS AND MORE HURRICANES.</p>
<p><strong>Maria Lopez-Nuñez -- Deputy Director of Organizing and Advocacy, Ironbound Community Corporation</strong></p>
<p>Anybody who lives here can tell you it's getting rainier and rainier. So, I actually think the geography of the Ironbound is gonna change, like, the way it looks. The space that the river occupies is gonna change. And I'm not sure... I worry, right? When I look on a map, I worry about where the Diamond Alkali site is, and that increased rain, that river depth, that river boundary. I worry the river will take the Diamond Alkali site with it and what that will mean, you know, will the cap hold?</p>
<p>REGARDLESS OF THE CLEANUP METHOD... SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.</p>
<p>THE PRICE TAG RIGHT NOW IS $1.8 BILLION... THE MOST EXPENSIVE CLEANUP IN THE HISTORY OF THE SUPERFUND PROGRAM.</p>
<p>DIAMOND ALKALI IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RIVER'S POLLUTION. BUT OTHER COMPANIES POLLUTED THE RIVER TOO.</p>
<p>THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG TO CLEAN UP THE SITE... NO ONE THINKS THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLLUTION AND WANTS TO PAY.</p>
<p>FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR JIM FLORIO SPEARHEADED THE SUPERFUND LAW WHILE HE WAS IN CONGRESS IN 1980.</p>
<p><strong>Gov. Jim Florio -- D, NJ 1st Congressional District 1975-1990, Governor 1990-1994</strong></p>
<p>One of the principles we built into the law was that the polluters should pay, and it would be the mantra. And we've changed things. And my grandchildren, to this day, they're adults now, but they mention, &quot;Pop Pop was in charge of getting the dolphins back.&quot;</p>

<p>FLORIO... NOW AN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER... HAS SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO REINSTATE A TAX ON THE OIL AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. THIS TAX EXPIRED IN 1995.</p>
<p>MONEY FROM THE TAX WOULD GO INTO THE SUPER...FUND TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP OF &quot;ORPHAN&quot; SITES. THESE ARE TOXIC PLACES WHERE THE POLLUTER IS UNKNOWN OR UNABLE TO PONY UP THE FUNDS TO CLEAN UP THE MESS.</p>
<p>IN THE PAST FEW YEARS... SENATOR CORY BOOKER... FORMER MAYOR OF NEWARK... AND REPRESENTATIVE FRANK PALLONE HAVE PUSHED TO REINSTATE THE TAX ON OIL COMPANIES.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Cory Booker -- D, New Jersey</strong></p>
<p>Well, you have these polluting companies, chemical companies, oil companies that we know, are offsetting a lot of their costs onto society. And it's about putting a very small tax on those companies that then is directed towards Superfund cleanup. And what we've seen since the Superfund tax was eliminated the number of Superfund sites in America has actually gone up, not down. And so it yields enough money to really start focusing and getting some of this cleanup done on these orphan sites where we can't hold someone accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>BUT SO FAR... THE BILL HAS STALLED IN CONGRESS.</p>
<p>REPRESENTATIVE PALLONE SAYS THERE'S ONE WAY TO GET THE POLLUTERS TO PAY.</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Frank Pallone -- D, NJ 6th Congressional District</strong></p>
<p>The majority of the cleanup is done by the polluter or paid for by the polluter under direction of the EPA. And so, you just have to constantly push and embarrass them and, you know, sometimes bring people to public hearings where they criticize the proposed plans that they have for cleanup because they're not adequate. So that's the kind of thing that I do.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>LAST YEAR... PRESIDENT BIDEN'S INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE INCLUDED THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE SUPERFUND TAX ON SOME CHEMICAL COMPANIES... BUT NOT OIL AND GAS.</p>
<p>I'M A HUGE HORROR FAN... SO WHEN I THINK OF SUPERFUND SITES... I THINK OF THAT MONSTER FROM THE MOVIE JEEPERS CREEPERS.</p>
<p>OKAY... BEAR WITH ME HERE. SO IN THE MOVIE JEEPERS CREEPERS...</p>
<p>SOME OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE WHERE THE MOVIE TAKES PLACE KNOW ABOUT THE MONSTER.</p>
<p>THEY KNOW IT COMES OUT EVERY 23rd SPRING FOR 23 DAYS, YOU KNOW, TO EAT PEOPLE.</p>
<p>BUT THE FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO GET RID OF IT HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL... SO THEY JUST LIVE WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE THAT EVENTUALLY THE MONSTER WILL COME BACK AND WREAK HAVOC.</p>
<p>IT'S THIS IDEA OF THE MONSTER LURKING IN THE BACKYARD THAT I'M DRAWN TO... AND SUPERFUND SITES ARE THOSE MONSTERS.</p>
<p>THEY MAY NOT HAVE WINGS... IN THE CASE OF THE JEEPERS CREEPERS MONSTER... BUT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS WHEN IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.</p>
<p><strong>David Robinson -- New Jersey State Climatologist</strong></p>
<p>We've seen sea levels rise and the rise is accelerating, the pace of the increase is accelerating. And areas that are very close to sea level are getting inundated with a frequency we've not seen previously.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>QUOTES LIKE THAT FROM DAVE ROBINSON... NEW JERSEY'S STATE CLIMATOLOGIST... REALLY UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO CLEAN UP SUPERFUND SITES LIKE DIAMOND ALKALI... NOW.</p>
<p><strong>David Robinson -- New Jersey State Climatologist</strong></p>
<p>I think we have to look to what the future may hold for all of these threats. And they're a little bit grim. So, we better be prepared and be able to adapt and accommodate these changes when it comes to Superfund sites or everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>IT'S HARD FOR ME TO STAY OPTIMISTIC WHEN THE CLEANUP OF THE DIAMOND ALKALI SITE IS STILL YEARS AWAY.</p>
<p>AND NO ONE KNOWS IF IT'LL EVER BE SAFE TO SWIM OR FISH IN THE PASSAIC.</p>
<p>BUT I CAN'T HELP REMEMBERING SOMETHING ANA TOLD ME DURING OUR TIME AT THE PARK.</p>
<p><strong>Ana Baptista -- Co-Chair, Passaic River Superfund Community Advisory Group</strong></p>
<p>You can almost imagine a river with, teeming with oysters and clams, and it wasn't even tidal back then in the 1600s, we turned it tidal. We messed with it so much. But one day, we won't get back there, but we'll get back to something, something so that at least people can enjoy the river to some extent more than they are now even.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>HAZARD IS A SPACE NOT JUST FOR LEARNING ABOUT SUPERFUND SITES... BUT FOR ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES IN CONVERSATION AROUND THE CLEANUP OF THESE TOXIC PLACES.</p>

<p>Growing up in Bridgewater, New Jersey, Peggy Fussell has fond memories of ice skating on a local pond. That is, until she discovered that the pond was a toxic waste site.</p>
<p>Decades after chemical producer American Cyanamid ceased its Bridgewater operations, and was declared a Superfund site, its toxic legacy is precariously contained in local waste ponds. As climate change fuels more intense storms in the region, these ponds risk flooding and spilling over into the nearby community.</p>
<p>With a cleanup that has dragged on for decades and has no clear end in sight, what will it take to avoid catastrophe?</p>
<p>Support for Hazard NJ is provided by Peril and Promise, a public media reporting initiative covering the human stories of climate change and its solutions, with major funding provided by Dr. P. Roy Vagelos and Diana T. Vagelos. You can learn more at <a href="https://pbs.org/perilandpromise" target="_blank">pbs.org/perilandpromise</a></p>

<p>--CARBON DISULFIDE</p>
<p>THIS WITCHES BREW OF CHEMICALS WERE MIXED TOGETHER BY AMERICAN CYANAMID IN BRIDGEWATER, NEW JERSEY.</p>
<p>THE COMPANY'S CAULDRON OF CHOICE WAS TWO LARGE HUMAN-MADE PONDS NEAR THE RARITAN RIVER.</p>
<p>SHROUDED BY TREES AND AWAY FROM ONLOOKERS... THESE PONDS SAT STILL BY THE RIVER'S EDGE FOR DECADES.</p>
<p>UNTIL RECENT FLOODING SHOWED US WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF SITES LIKE AMERICAN CYANAMID AREN'T CLEANED UP.</p>
<p>EVERY TIME WE GET A MAJOR STORM WE RUN THE RISK OF TOXINS SEEPING INTO OUR WATERWAYS.</p>
<p>AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS MAKING THINGS WORSE.</p>
<p>THIS IS HAZARD... A LIMITED SERIES ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SUPERFUND SITES HERE IN NEW JERSEY.</p>
<p>I'M JORDAN GASS-POORE'... AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST FROM TEXAS. I GREW UP HEARING STORIES ABOUT THREE-EYED FISH IN THE RIVER AND WONDERING WHY THE TAP WATER I WAS DRINKING WAS ORANGE.</p>
<p>I WAS THAT KID WHO STOOD UP IN FRONT OF CLASS AND ASKED PEOPLE TO SIGN MY PETITION TO SAVE THE RAINFOREST.</p>
<p>IT'S GOTTEN SLIGHTLY EASIER OVER THE YEARS TO GET PEOPLE TO CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT... ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HAZARDOUS SUPERFUND SITES.</p>
<p>THOSE ARE THE MOST TOXIC SITES IN THE COUNTRY... AND NEW JERSEY IS HOME TO 114 OF THEM. THAT'S THE MOST OUT OF ANY STATE.</p>
<p>AMERICAN CYANAMID IS A TRIPLE THREAT: IT'S LOCATED IN A FLOODPLAIN... REGULARLY FLOODS... AND IS VULNERABLE TO HURRICANES.</p>
<p>SO... IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY MARK SCHMIDT IS CONCERNED. HE'S THE EPA PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE SUPERFUND SITE.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Schmidt -- EPA Remedial Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>Could these impoundments erode? Could all the infrastructure, you know, we have a groundwater treatment facility, electrical infrastructure, could all that be washed away?</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>I RECENTLY VISITED AMERICAN CYANAMID.</p>
<p>IT WAS SO... INNOCUOUS. AND PEACEFUL. THE SILENCE WAS OCCASIONALLY PIERCED BY A HORN AND THE RATTLE OF AN NJ TRANSIT TRAIN... DELIVERING COMMUTERS TO THEIR HOMES NEARBY.</p>
<p>MY NERVES DIDN'T KICK IN UNTIL I GOT HOME THAT EVENING AND NOTICED SOME LIGHT BROWN DUST ON MY BOOTS. I NOW CALL THESE SHOES MY &quot;SUPER BOOTS.&quot;</p>
<p>BACK ON THE SITE... WITH MY &quot;SUPER BOOTS&quot; AND SHOTGUN MIC... I SAW WHITE SIGNS ON SUPPORT POLES THAT SHOWED HOW HIGH THE FLOODWATERS GOT DURING:</p>
<p>--TROPICAL STORM DORIA IN 1971... NEARLY 38 FEET.</p>
<p>--HURRICANE FLOYD IN 1999... SLIGHTLY OVER 42 FEET.</p>
<p>--HURRICANE IRENE IN 2011... RIGHT AROUND 42 FEET.</p>
<p>--AND TROPICAL STORM IDA... A RECORD 43 FEET.</p>
<p>AMID THE DOOM AND GLOOM... A FEW THINGS STOOD OUT TO ME:</p>
<p>THERE WAS A WOODPECKER ON AN ELECTRICAL POLE...</p>
<p>...AND DUCKS IN THE PONDS.</p>
<p>THESE SIGNS OF LIFE ARE ENCOURAGING... AND GIVE ME HOPE THAT ONE DAY THE SITE WILL BE A LOVELY... WHOLE FOODS.</p>
<p>THE NEXT TIME IT FLOODS... WILL HAZARDOUS WASTE LEAK OUT OF THE AMERICAN CYANAMID SITE AND SNEAK INTO THE RARITAN RIVER?</p>
<p>OR COULD IT SEEP INTO THE BRUNSWICK AQUIFER... NEW JERSEY'S SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER?</p>
<p>THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE... OR THE GAO... MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN 2019 TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN.</p>
<p><strong>Alfredo Gomez -- GAO Director, Natural Resources and Environment team</strong></p>
<p>So, what we learned was that people wanted more direction. They wanted sort of forward-looking climate information, so they can make better decisions about risk responses, about risk assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>ALFREDO GOMEZ IS A DIRECTOR WITH THE GAO'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT TEAM.</p>
<p>HIS TEAM FOUND THAT MORE THAN 60% OF THE COUNTRY'S SUPERFUND SITES ARE IN PLACES VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.</p>
<p><strong>Alfredo Gomez -- GAO Director, Natural Resources and Environment team</strong></p>
<p>Now, interestingly, in New Jersey, that percentage was a lot higher, it was 88% of the Superfund sites are located in places that may be affected by one or more of these climate change effects.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THE REPORT DIDN'T LOOK INTO HOW CLIMATE CHANGE MAY IMPACT CLEANUP EFFORTS.</p>
<p>AS LONG AS THE POLLUTION REMAINS, HURRICANES AND FLOODING ARE A MAJOR THREAT TO SITES LIKE AMERICAN CYANAMID... AND TO OUR HEALTH.</p>
<p>IF THIS SITE ISN'T SECURED BEFORE ANOTHER HURRICANE OR FLOOD... IT COULD SPREAD CHEMICALS THROUGH THE RIVER AND WIND. IF CHEMICALS GET IN THE GROUNDWATER... IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TRACK.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Schmidt -- EPA Remedial Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>So, based on what has happened, we're concerned with the flooding events. We've been fortunate that nothing has happened. But, you know, what's the future gonna look like?</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>ALRIGHT... I JUST SPENT THE PAST FEW MINUTES THROWING AROUND A LOT OF TERMS I RECENTLY LEARNED HOW TO PRONOUNCE CORRECTLY... AND SERVED UP A HEARTY HELPING OF ACRONYM SOUP.</p>
<p>SO... I'M GOING TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND BREAK DOWN THE BASICS.</p>
<p>SUPERFUND... EMPHASIS ON FUND... NOT FUN... WAS A PROGRAM CREATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN 1980 TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES.</p>
<p>AT THE TIME... THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY... OR EPA... THOUGHT THERE WERE RELATIVELY FEW TOXIC SITES IN THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p>BUT OFFICIALS SOON DISCOVERED THOUSANDS OF CONTAMINATED SITES. SO, THEY CREATED A NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST TO FIGURE OUT WHICH PLACES NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP FIRST.</p>
<p>IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE AMERICAN CYANAMID SITE TO BE INCLUDED ON THIS LIST.</p>
<p>SOME OF THE CHEMICALS THE COMPANY MADE ARE NOW KNOWN CARCINOGENS. THIS LINK WAS MADE BACK IN 1978... WHEN MORE THAN 1,000 WORKERS AT THE BRIDGEWATER PLANT WENT ON STRIKE.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Sobel -- New Jersey Nightly News, 1978</strong></p>
<p>More than 300 -- 1,300 workers at American Cyanamid's Bridgewater plant walked out on strike today, protesting low wages and poor safety conditions. Local 111 of the International Chemical Workers Union claims the company has ignored complaints of high rates of bladder cancer and lung disease among workers. Cyanamid wouldn't comment on that charge, but a spokesman says the company can't grant the 75-cent-an-hour pay hike because, said the Union, it exceeds President Carter's wage and price guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>IN SEPTEMBER 1983... AMERICAN CYANAMID WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES TO BE DESIGNATED A SUPERFUND SITE.</p>
<p>THAT'S NO REAL SURPRISE.</p>
<p>FOR NEARLY A CENTURY... NUMEROUS COMPANIES USED THIS 575-ACRE SITE FOR CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING.</p>
<p>THE TOXIC WASTE FROM THIS PRODUCTION WAS STORED IN HUMAN-MADE PONDS CALLED IMPOUNDMENTS. EVENTUALLY... THE PONDS LEECHED CHEMICALS IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER.</p>
<p>THERE ARE 27 OF THESE PONDS AT AMERICAN CYANAMID... AND THE EPA SAYS 16 OF THESE BAD BOYS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE POLLUTION ON THE PROPERTY.</p>
<p>BUT THE GRANDDADDY OF THEM ALL ARE IMPOUNDMENTS 1 AND 2. THE EPA GAVE THE PONDS NUMBERS TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM ALL.</p>
<p>THESE TWO PONDS ARE CONSIDERED BY THE EPA TO HAVE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.</p>
<p>THEY CONTAIN ACID TAR SLUDGE. THAT'S A BYPRODUCT OF THE SITE'S DAYS AS AN OIL REFINERY.</p>
<p>JUST GOES TO SHOW... SOMETIMES THE PAST STICKS WITH YOU.</p>
<p>AMERICAN CYANAMID IS ONE OF THE MORE COMPLEX SUPERFUND SITES IN TERMS OF CLEANUP.</p>
<p>AND MARK SAYS THE PONDS ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Schmidt -- EPA Remedial Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>Each of these impoundments had different waste. Back in the, you know, early days, the '40s and the '50s, there wasn't a lot of thought about what would happen if you put waste into these impoundments.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>EVEN WHILE CHEMICAL WASTE WAS BEING DUMPED NEXT TO THE RARITAN RIVER... SOMEONE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SITE WAS ON A FLOODPLAIN AND TOOK ACTION.</p>
<p>IN THE 1930S... PONDS WERE CREATED ON THE SITE TO TRAP CHEMICAL WASTEWATER AND PREVENT THE TOXIC SOUP FROM POURING INTO THE RIVER.</p>
<p>DECADES LATER IN 2011... HEAVY RAINS FROM HURRICANE IRENE FLOODED PART OF THE SITE.</p>
<p>IMPOUNDMENTS 1 AND 2 WERE HIT HARD. THE TEMPORARY CAPS THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED ON THESE SPOTS WERE DAMAGED.</p>
<p>CAPPING IS ONE WAY OF CLEANING UP A SUPERFUND SITE. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP CHEMICALS IN PLACE TO PREVENT THEM FROM SPREADING. BUT IN THIS CASE... IT DIDN'T WORK.</p>
<p>THE CAPS COULDN'T WITHSTAND THE FLOODING AND SOME OF THAT ACID TAR SLUDGE WAS EXPOSED.</p>
<p>TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE... THE EPA NOW REQUIRES THAT ALL FUTURE CAPS BE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND THE EFFECTS OF MORE FREQUENT FLOODING</p>
<p>THEN LAST  SUMMER... HURRICANE IDA HAMMERED DOWN ON THE SITE... AND FLOOD LEVELS SET A NEW RECORD.</p>
<p>LUCKILY... EPA TESTS AFTER BOTH FLOODS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT RELEASE OF TOXINS IN THE RARITAN RIVER.</p>
<p>FOR NOW.</p>
<p>AT ITS PEAK... THE AMERICAN CYANAMID COMPLEX SPREAD OVER 600 ACRES ACROSS BRIDGEWATER AND BOUND BROOK.</p>
<p>THE COMPANY WAS ONCE ONE OF SOMERSET COUNTY'S LARGEST EMPLOYERS. THEY HIRED MORE THAN 5,000 PEOPLE WHO PRODUCED DYES... PIGMENTS... AND OTHER CHEMICALS BY THE TRAINLOAD.</p>
<p>PEGGY FUSSELL'S GRANDMOTHER WORKED FOR AMERICAN CYANAMID AS A TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR.</p>
<p>FOR HOURS A DAY... HER GRANDMOTHER... ANNE FUSSELL... WOULD WATCH FOR CALLS THAT APPEARED AS LIGHTS ON A BOARD.</p>
<p>AT THE END OF HER SHIFT... SHE WOULD WALK THE FEW MINUTES TO HER HOME.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>She was what was called a hard luck story because she was a single mom, three kids. And so the corporation, the company, subsidized her housing. So we lived on a street that was for people who had fallen on hard times.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>ONE OF HER CHILDREN WAS PEGGY'S DAD... WHO ENDED UP WORKING ODD JOBS AT AMERICAN CYANAMID... AND LIVING RIGHT NEXT TO HIS MOM.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>The reason I grew up there was because my dad grew up there. And then when my mother was pregnant with me, he was visiting his mother and found out that someone was moving out. And he said, &quot;I am looking for housing now. Can I live in this house until I find something better, until the baby's born?&quot; That baby was me.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>ON THE SURFACE... THE TWO-BEDROOM... ONE BATH BUNGALOW ON MIDLAND AVENUE SEEMED LIKE AN IDYLLIC PLACE TO GROW UP.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>One of the perks of living there was that we had a backyard and then behind the yard were fields and woods, and lots of places to play. I felt like I grew up in the country, even though I was in pretty much suburban New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore'</strong></p>
<p>PHOTOS OF PEGGY AS A CHILD SHOW HER STANDING IN HER BACKYARD.</p>
<p>IN ANOTHER ONE... SHE'S WEARING SUNGLASSES AND TAKING HER DOLLS FOR A STROLL DOWN THE BLOCK.</p>
<p>THE SEASONS CHANGE... SHE'S TALLER... WITH LONGER HAIR... BUT THE ONE CONSTANT IN THIS SCRAPBOOK IS THE AMERICAN CYANAMID FACTORY... LOOMING LARGE OVER PEGGY'S CHILDHOOD.</p>
<p>IN THE WINTER... PEGGY SAYS SHE WOULD ICE SKATE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL FLAT POND NEAR HER HOUSE.</p>
<p>OTHER PONDS HAD LEAVES AND OTHER VEGETATION IN ITS WATERS... BUT NOT THIS ONE.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>The ponds were just murky. You know, they didn't look like they would make you sick or anything, they just looked like murky ponds.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THOSE PONDS STORED HAZARDOUS WASTE FOR AMERICAN CYANAMID.</p>
<p>PEGGY SAYS HER SKATING DAYS ENDED EARLY WHEN HER PARENTS REALIZED WHAT WAS GOING ON.</p>
<p>EVEN SO... IT WAS HARD TO ESCAPE THE COMPANY'S TRAPS FROM THE PAST.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>There was an orchard. When I was very young there were cows and a dairy at the end of the street. And when you think about what it means to drink milk from cows that are eating grass that's on the grounds of a chemical factories. And we had a well. We had well-water.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>NOW, AT 60 YEARS OLD ... PEGGY WONDERS IF THE WELL-WATER SHE DRANK AS A KID MAY HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED BY AMERICAN CYANAMID.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>I don't think those conversations were had. I know that they weren't had in my house.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>WHAT THE FAMILY DID TALK ABOUT WAS HER AUNT'S WORK AT AMERICAN CYANAMID. MARY-LOUISE VEGA WAS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT THE PLANT.</p>
<p>HER CLAIM TO FAME WAS INVENTING A TYPE OF GLOW STICK USED BY THE MILITARY CALLED CYALUME.</p>
<p><strong>Peggy Fussell</strong></p>
<p>The joke was, you know, at some point we're all gonna glow.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>AMERICAN CYANAMID OFFICIALLY TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS IN 1999 WHEN THEY STOPPED MANUFACTURING IN BRIDGEWATER.</p>
<p>THEN... POOF.</p>
<p>BUILDINGS WERE DEMOLISHED THE FOLLOWING YEAR... AND TODAY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A SPRAWLING FACTORY ON THE SITE.</p>
<p>WHERE PEGGY'S GRANDMOTHER AND AUNT WORKED... CYANAMID'S OFFICES AND LABS... IS NOW A SHOPPING CENTER AND A STADIUM FOR THE MINOR LEAGUE SOMERSET PATRIOTS.</p>
<p>PEGGY'S CHILDHOOD HOME IS NOW A STARBUCKS.</p>
<p>JENNY KETROW... A FORMER BRIDGEWATER RESIDENT... SAYS HER DAD AND GRANDFATHER USED TO WORK ON THE AMERICAN CYANAMID SITE.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Ketrow</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes my mom still talks about it, my dad would come home with, like, pink dye or red dye soaked into his undergarments, and she would do the laundry separate from our laundry. And, you know, especially, like, a couple of jobs, he had jackhammering out dye in a vat that was, you know, like, sending humans in there to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>THE FAMILY HAD A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICAN CYANAMID. ON ONE HAND... IT WAS A SOURCE OF PRIDE TO HAVE RELATIVES WORK THERE. ON THE OTHER HAND... BY THE TIME JENNY WAS BORN IN 1984... IT WAS ALREADY LISTED AS A SUPERFUND SITE.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Ketrow</strong></p>
<p>You also feared it because &quot;Wow, I could die at this job. You know, I'm basically risking my life for my family and for my livelihood. But, you know, I can put a roof over my head and feed everybody and have a sense of pride, like, I can afford the nicer things.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>SHE SAYS ONE OF HER DAD'S JOBS WAS TO ROW A BOAT OUT ONTO THE PONDS. THERE... HE WOULD STIR THE WATER TO KEEP THE CHEMICALS FROM POOLING TOGETHER.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Ketrow</strong></p>
<p>I remember him saying, like, he would have to go sometimes with a scientist or, like, a lab technician and go take samples. So, they had a metal rowboat. I don't think they really had anything other than maybe, like, a jumpsuit to wear, but not like a safety jumpsuit, more like a denim jumpsuit, the typical work wear that the guys wore.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>JENNY REMEMBERS BEING TOLD THE STORY ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE WHO ALMOST FELL INTO THE POND BECAUSE THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BOAT HAD ROTTED OUT.</p>
<p>SHE BELIEVES THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE POND WATER WAS SO TOXIC IT DISSOLVED THE BOAT'S METAL.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Ketrow</strong></p>
<p>And at one point I guess something reacted with the chemicals and one of the boats started to have rot to it. One of the safety procedures was, like, check the bottom of the boat, make sure it's sound, make sure it's safe before we put it in. And then my father put it in, and then the new guy was just about to jump in. But the boat kind of sank and deteriorated. And my father grabbed the new guy and just threw him back onto the platform. I'm pretty sure that was my father's last day on that detail because I think he told his supervisor, like, &quot;Look, you know, I have a family. I'm not doing this. Like, this is not, no.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>HER HOPE IS THAT THESE PONDS WILL BE CLEANED UP SOON.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny Ketrow</strong></p>
<p>Just turn it back into nature. And maybe that'll help with some of the flooding that's coming through because that area it still floods. Pretty much anytime we have a nor'easter hurricane, remnants of tropical storms, it floods. So let nature have it back.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' Host</strong></p>
<p>ALL OF THIS LAND... KNOWN AS THE HILL PROPERTY... WAS REMOVED FROM THE SUPERFUND LIST IN 1998.</p>
<p>THE REMAINING 435 ACRES OF THE SITE WERE BOUGHT BY PFIZER IN 2009.</p>
<p>THAT COMPANY'S NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING IT UP.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Schmidt -- EPA Remedial Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>You know, we learned a lot through Irene. Ida, we learned even more, so there's still quite a bit of resiliency work that's going to go into the next phase of work.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Gass-Poore' -- Host</strong></p>
<p>SECURING THE AMERICAN CYANAMID SITE MEANS A FEWS THINGS.</p>
<p>AFTER HURRICANE IDA DEVASTATED THE NORTHEAST IN 2021...</p>
<p>SOME FACILITIES WERE RELOCATED TO AREAS NOT WITHIN A FLOODPLAIN... OTHER PARTS WERE MOVED TO HIGHER GROUND... AND AN ON-SITE WEATHER STATION WAS PUT ON THE PROPERTY.</p>
<p>THE TOXIC ACID TAR IN IMPOUNDMENTS 1 AND 2 HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND ARE BEING TREATED OFFSITE BECAUSE THEY'RE AT RISK OF BEING FLOODED.</p>
<p>CLEANUP AT AMERICAN CYANAMID HAS DRAGGED ON FOR DECADES.</p>
<p>SINCE BEING DESIGNATED A SUPERFUND SITE NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO... ONLY ABOUT 80 ACRES HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP.</p>
<p>IT'S EXPECTED TO TAKE FIVE-TO-TEN MORE YEARS FOR CLEANUP TO BE COMPLETE.</p>
<p>HAZARD IS A SPACE NOT JUST FOR LEARNING ABOUT SUPERFUND SITES... BUT FOR ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES IN CONVERSATION AROUND THE CLEANUP OF THESE TOXIC PLACES.</p>

<h2 id="the-hazard-podcast-coming-soon!" tabindex="-1">The Hazard Podcast, coming soon!</h2>
<p>They’re the most polluted places in the country, and no state has more than New Jersey.</p>
<p>There are 114 toxic Superfund sites scattered across the Garden State, and that number is growing. As cleanup efforts drag on for those sites, in some cases for nearly 40 years, climate change is reshaping the ways in which their pollution may threaten people living nearby.</p>
<p>Hazard NJ is a new podcast that digs through the muck of each contaminated site to give a clearer picture of what the threat is and what it will take to clean it up before it’s too late. Hosted by journalist Jordan Gass-Poore’ and produced by NJ Spotlight News, Hazard NJ is a limited series with the first episode coming on May 18.</p>
