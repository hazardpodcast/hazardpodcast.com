Few people have had as much impact on efforts to clean up New Jersey and America’s toxic messes as former New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio, who died on Sept. 25 at age 85. Before he was governor, Florio spent 15 years representing the Camden area in Congress. Arguably his crowning achievement in Washington was writing, and then pushing through, the Superfund law. The measure created the federal program that is dedicated to cleaning up some of the nation’s most hazardous pollution, and does so under the principle that the polluter should pay.

In this bonus episode, Hazard NJ reflects on Florio’s efforts to clean up dangerous pollution by revisiting an interview recorded with him earlier this year.
