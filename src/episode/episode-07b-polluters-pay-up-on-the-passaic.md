<iframe title="BONUS Episode: Polluters Pay Up on the Passaic" allowtransparency="true" style="border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);" scrolling="no" data-name="pb-iframe-player" src="https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?from=embed&pbad=0&i=4zzp3-133e0c4-pb&square=1&share=1&download=1&fonts=Arial&skin=f6f6f6&font-color=&rtl=0&logo_link=&btn-skin=7&size=300" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="300"></iframe>

Efforts to clean up the lower stretch of the Passaic River are getting a $150 million boost, thanks to a new settlement between the federal government and 85 likely polluters. This stretch of the river, running through Newark and nearby towns, is coated with a lining of toxic mud, tainted by decades and decades of chemical dumping. Getting it cleaned up will be difficult – and expensive. At roughly $1.8 billion, the Passaic River is estimated to be the costliest project currently facing the EPA’s Superfund program. That makes the settlement a small, but welcome, step forward.
